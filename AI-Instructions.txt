Here is the website URL to the above data: <website url>. I want you to determine the relevence of this website to this event: <event-title> and its description: <event-description>. Here is the event themes: <Event-themes> This is with regards to whether that website is helping the user complete the event or being a distraction. If it is clearly a distraction, respond with 'not relevent'. If it is clearly helping the user complete the event, respond with 'relevent'. If this website is an all purpose website, ie google documents, chatgpt, or youtube, then respond with 'relevent'. The content should override the websiteURL reputation. For example, reddit is usually considered a distraction, but if the user is looking in reddit related to a question about the event, say 'relevent' rather than 'not relevent'. However, if there is no content from the data given above, then use the websiteURL's reputation to determine worth blocking or not. To help, dont just analyze the website content and see if its connectable to the users event. Try analyzing the purpose of the website, and see if that serves to get the users event done. If you believe the website has a 50%+ relevence, respond with 'relevent'. If you believe the website is not relevent (40%> relevence), respond with 'not relevent'. If you are not sure (40%-55% relevence), respond with 'not sure'. DO NOT RESPOND WITH REASONING, JUST STATE YOUR ANSWER!
